# Blog Review

Review blog posts with category-appropriate standards to ensure quality and readability before publication.

## Review Workflow

1. **Identify the post**: Locate the markdown file in `_posts/`
2. **Check frontmatter**: Verify the `category` field (tech or daily)
3. **Load appropriate criteria**: Read the relevant review criteria reference
4. **Analyze the post**: Review against the criteria checklist
5. **Provide feedback**: Offer structured, actionable improvement suggestions

## Review Categories

### Tech Posts (category: tech)

Apply professional tech blog standards. Read [tech-review-criteria.md](references/tech-review-criteria.md) for the complete checklist covering:

- Structure and organization
- Content quality and accuracy
- Writing style and clarity
- Reader value and practical insights

Provide detailed feedback on technical accuracy, clarity, and presentation.

### Daily Posts (category: daily)

Apply basic quality and appropriateness standards. Read [daily-review-criteria.md](references/daily-review-criteria.md) for the complete checklist covering:

- Content appropriateness for public viewing
- Privacy and respect considerations
- Basic readability and coherence
- Reader engagement

Be more lenient - focus on genuine issues rather than over-editing personal expression.

## Blog Structure Reference

For understanding the project's blog structure, frontmatter format, and file organization, read [blog-structure.md](references/blog-structure.md).

## Feedback Format

Structure all feedback as:

1. **Overall Assessment**: Brief summary of the post's strengths and key areas for improvement
2. **Detailed Feedback**: Organized by section or theme with:
   - Issue identified
   - Why it matters
   - Specific, actionable suggestion
3. **Priority Items**: Highlight critical issues that should be addressed before publication
4. **Optional Enhancements**: Suggestions that would improve the post but aren't essential
