- **Well-structured**: Use headings, sections, and formatting effectively
- **Informative**: Provide value through insights, explanations, or practical examples
- **Professional**: Maintain a professional tone appropriate for a tech blog

## Review Checklist

### Structure and Organization

- [ ] **Clear introduction**: Does the post start with a clear context or problem statement?
- [ ] **Logical flow**: Do sections progress logically from one to the next?
- [ ] **Appropriate headings**: Are headings descriptive and properly hierarchical?
- [ ] **Conclusion or summary**: Does the post wrap up key points effectively?

### Content Quality

- [ ] **Accuracy**: Are technical details correct and up-to-date?
- [ ] **Completeness**: Are important details or steps missing?
- [ ] **Code examples**: If present, are they clear, correct, and well-formatted?
- [ ] **Visual aids**: Are images, diagrams, or code blocks used effectively?

### Writing Style

- [ ] **Clarity**: Is the writing clear and easy to follow?
- [ ] **Tone**: Is the tone professional yet approachable?
- [ ] **Grammar and spelling**: Are there obvious errors that should be corrected?
- [ ] **Technical terminology**: Is jargon explained or used appropriately?

### Reader Value

- [ ] **Practical value**: Will readers gain actionable knowledge or insights?
- [ ] **Context**: Is sufficient background provided for the target audience?
- [ ] **Examples**: Are concrete examples provided where appropriate?

## Common Issues to Flag

1. **Unclear explanations**: Technical concepts that need more clarification
2. **Missing context**: Assumptions about reader knowledge that should be stated
3. **Poor code formatting**: Code blocks that are hard to read or missing syntax highlighting
4. **Weak introduction**: Posts that dive into details without proper setup
5. **Abrupt ending**: Posts that end without wrapping up key points
6. **Broken flow**: Sections that don't connect well or seem out of order

## Improvement Suggestions Format

When providing feedback, structure suggestions as:

1. **Issue identified**: What needs improvement
2. **Why it matters**: Impact on reader experience
3. **Suggested fix**: Specific, actionable recommendation

Example:
```
Issue: The introduction jumps directly into implementation details without explaining the problem being solved.
Why: Readers need context to understand why this solution matters.
Suggestion: Add 2-3 sentences explaining the use case or problem before diving into the solution.
```
