# Daily Blog Review Criteria

This document outlines the review criteria for personal/daily blog posts (category: daily).

## Core Principles

Daily blog posts allow for creative freedom and personal expression, but should still:
- **Be appropriate for public consumption**: No content that would be embarrassing or inappropriate if widely read
- **Maintain basic readability**: Even personal posts should be coherent and easy to follow
- **Show respect**: Avoid content that could be offensive or unnecessarily controversial
- **Protect privacy**: Avoid oversharing personal information that could be problematic

## Review Checklist

### Content Appropriateness

- [ ] **Public-safe**: Is this content appropriate for a public portfolio/blog?
- [ ] **Privacy**: Does it reveal sensitive personal information?
- [ ] **Respect**: Is the content respectful of others mentioned?
- [ ] **Professional image**: Would this content negatively impact professional image?

### Basic Quality

- [ ] **Coherence**: Is the post reasonably easy to follow?
- [ ] **Grammar**: Are there glaring grammar or spelling issues?
- [ ] **Structure**: Does it have some basic organization (even if informal)?
- [ ] **Images**: If images are included, are they appropriate and properly attributed?

### Reader Experience

- [ ] **Context**: Will readers unfamiliar with the topic be able to follow along?
- [ ] **Engagement**: Is the content interesting or engaging in some way?
- [ ] **Completeness**: Does the post feel finished (not abruptly cut off)?

## Common Issues to Flag

1. **Too much personal information**: Details that shouldn't be public
2. **Unclear context**: Assuming too much reader knowledge about private matters
3. **Negative content about others**: Complaints or criticism that could be problematic
4. **Inconsistent tone**: Switching between very casual and formal in jarring ways
5. **Missing explanations**: Inside jokes or references that need brief context

## Improvement Suggestions Format

For daily posts, keep suggestions focused on:

1. **Safety/appropriateness concerns**: If any content should be reconsidered
2. **Major clarity issues**: Only if the post is very hard to follow
3. **Basic quality**: Grammar issues that significantly impact readability

Be more lenient than with tech posts - the goal is to catch genuine issues, not to over-edit personal expression.

Example:
```
Issue: The post mentions specific names of people who might not want to be identified publicly.
Why: This could cause privacy concerns for the individuals mentioned.
Suggestion: Consider using pseudonyms or generic terms like "a friend" instead of real names.
```
